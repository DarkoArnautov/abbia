<h1 class="is-uppercase is-size-1"><span>Our Head Farmer:</span> Robert Mbilongoe</h1>
Robert Mbilongoe is a treasure. 

He is our lead cocoa farmer and fermentation expert. As a third generation cocoa farmer from Manganga, a small village in the Centre Region of Cameroon, west Africa, his family has been cultivating cocoa since the early German colonization (1884-1915) when cocoa was first introduced to Cameroon. In addition to cocoa, his familyâ€™s farm produces plantains/bananas, mangoes, plums, mandarin oranges, avocados and wild fruit. 

Mr. Mbilongoe learned cocoa farming and the art of proper fermentation for cocoa beans from his grandfather, who settled the farm during the very beginning of German colonization. He continued to learn farming and fermentation from his father, who lived to be 105 years old. Even though Mr. Mbilongoe still works the fields in his early 70s, he is a well-educated former banker, as well as the former mayor for his region (an area larger than just the small village). His children are all educated, and his grandchildren all attend school. The same education ethic is true for all the families in his village.

Mr. Mbilongoe is married with 8 children and 10 grandchildren.

<h1 class="is-uppercase is-size-1"><span>Fine Cocoa in Cameroon?</span> Yes, indeed!</h1>
The small village of Manganga is where we are planting our flag.

Properly cultivated, well-fermented and carefully dried fine cocoa has been completely infeasible in Cameroon for more than three decades. The bulk cocoa market simply dominates all cocoa transactions and market demand for well-fermented quality beans is nil. The infrastructure for quality beans simply does not exist. But 30+ years ago, Cameroon supplied high-end cocoa to European markets, primarily France and Germany. Mr. Mbilongoe saw his grandfather, as well as his father, produce very high quality beans prior to the 1980s. These beans were fermented in proper wood boxes lined with banana leaves, and slow dried on elevated wooden racks. 

Now, in partnership with Jigoro Investments, Mr. Mbilongoe is organizing farmers in his village of Manganga from approximately a 4km radius to reintroduce the techniques of his youth, and to develop the best possible quality cocoa beans. We will centralize fermentation and drying in one location in or to keep quality high, with careful monitoring, collaborative fermentation and drying. Mr. Mbilongoe's farm has nearly 7 hectares and there are roughly a dozen more local farmers in Manganga who hope to join the collective, if demand rises to such a level. At present, we believe we can produce between 30-50 tons of specialty cocoa per season. 

In addition to building our fermentation boxes, drying racks and storage houses, much of our work for the past year has been focused on logistics: to build a parallel infrastructure to allow quality beans to be produced and shipped from the heart of industrialized cocoa production. It hasn't been easy. But we have a network that can not bring quality beans to market at scale.

Mr. Mbilongoe is excited to return his farm to quality production.
