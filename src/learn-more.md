<h1 class="is-uppercase is-size-1"><span>Our Head Farmer:</span> Robert Mbilongoe</h1>
Robert Mbilongoe is a treasure. 

He is our lead cocoa farmer and fermentation expert and a third generation cocoa farmer. Mr. Mbilongoe was born and raised on his family's farm in Manganga, a small village in Cameroon, central Africa. His family has been cultivating cocoa since the early German colonization (1884-1915) when cocoa was first introduced to Cameroon. In addition to cocoa, his farm produces plantains/bananas, mangoes, plums, mandarin oranges, avocados and wild fruit.

Mr. Mbilongoe learned the art of proper cocoa fermentation from his grandfather who settled the farm at onset of German colonization. He continued to learn from his father, who lived to be 105 years old. Mr. Mbilongoe is a well-educated former banker, as well as the former mayor for his region (an area larger than just the small village). His children are all educated and his grandchildren all attend school. The same education ethic is true for all the families in his village.

Mr. Mbilongoe is married with 8 children and 10 grandchildren, and still enjoys working his farm, even in his early 70s.

<h1 class="is-uppercase is-size-1"><span>Fine Cocoa from Cameroon?</span> Yes!</h1>
Mr. Mbilongoe's small village of Manganga is where we plant our flag.

It is true that proper cultivation, good fermentation and carefully dried fine cocoa has been completely infeasible in Cameroon for more than three decades. Today, the bulk cocoa market continues to dominate all cocoa transactions. In addition, the infrastructure to transport, ship and pay for quality beans, separate from bulk, simply does not exist in Cameroon. But more than thirty years ago, this was not the case. Cameroon supplied high-end cocoa to many European markets, primarily France and Germany. Mr. Mbilongoe grew up with his grandfather and his father cultivating very high quality cocoa, fermented in wood boxes lined with banana leaves, and slow dried on elevated wooden racks.

Now, in partnership with Jigoro Investments, Mr. Mbilongoe is bringing these techniques back. He is organizing the farmers in his village of Manganga to reintroduce the techniques of his youth and to develop the best possible quality cocoa beans. He will centralize fermentation and drying in one location, drawing beans from neighbor farms in a 4km radius. The centrailized fermentation and drying ensures consistent, high quality fermentation and drying. Mr. Mbilongoe's farm has nearly 7 hectares and there are roughly a dozen more local farmers in Manganga who hope to join the collective, if demand rises to such a level.

Mr. Mbilongoe is excited to return his farm to quality production.

<h1 class="is-uppercase is-size-1"><span>Our beginnings:</span> Jigoro Investments, NFP</h1>
Abbia Cocoa was started with seed money from [Jigoro Investments NFP](http://jigoro.org), a not-for-profit 501(c)3 dedicated to sustainable, ethical investments in Cameroon and other under-developed sub-Saharan countries. Please go to [Jigoro.org](http://jigoro.org) more more information about their work. In addition to supporting the construction of fermentation boxes, drying racks and storage houses, much of Jigoro's focus for the past year has been on logistics: to build a parallel infrastructure to allow quality beans to be produced and shipped from the heart of industrialized cocoa production.
