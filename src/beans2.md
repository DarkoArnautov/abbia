<h1 class="is-uppercase is-size-1"><span>Sample Beans:</span> Give us a call</h1>
We have a supply of cocoa beans available for sample. Please shoot us a note, or give us a call, and we will get you as much as you need to test. We are taking orders for delivery late this year, with shipment expected to be in November 2018.

<h1 class="is-uppercase is-size-1"><span>Organics & Fair Trade:</span> Where do we fit?</h1>
Mr. Mbilongoe and all of the other local Manganga farmers do not use any chemicals to fertilize or treat their farm in any way. First, they consider it a waste of money: yields do not increase. Second, these farmers have no desire to pollute or destroy their soil and water with chemicals. Nevertheless, the cost to become 'certified' organic is too high at this juncture, and there is no certification for their traditional farming practices.
